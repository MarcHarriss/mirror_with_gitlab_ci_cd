test for travis ci, with travis file

tag 0.0.2 test merge
test push to protected master branch v2

committing worked.

Now admins are enforced by the rules too

Doesn't prevent straight commits to master, only force push and overwriting previous commits
push to master with approval before merge requiring 1 review

now merge to master
